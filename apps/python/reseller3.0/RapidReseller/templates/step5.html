<h1>Step 5: Create a user on the customer account</h1>
<p>
    When a Google Apps instance is created, it is instantiated with 0 accounts.
    Resellers can act on behalf of their resold customers to provision accounts
    using the Admin SDK.

    Important: After creating a user, it is important to use the
    users.makeAdmin() call to promote the user to an administrator.
